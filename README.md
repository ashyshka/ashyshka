**Andrii Shyshka          Software Engineer/DevOps**

Executive Summary

I am a DevOps Engineer having over 20 years overall working experience, last 7 years as DevOps, other time as a System Administrator.

My experience also includes a technical leading and management role. In total, as a DevOps I’ve worked in more then 10 projects of different size and complexity for customers from small to large enterprise companies. I have a background in Cloud Computing (GCP mostly, AWS a bit), build K8S clusters at the on-premise Data Centers from a scratch. During my working experience my activities included (but not limited to) design, development, team leading activities, deployment, troubleshooting, maintenance, refactoring.

I have also an experience in Python scripting a bit for automation. I have expertise in Linux, networking, troubleshooting in the distributed environment. Most of the time I’ve worked according to Scrum, adapting it to the project needs.

I’m a pro-active person, self-motivated, I tend to be (end-) customer- focused. I develop myself towards a strong expertise in cloud computing, distributed systems and infrastructure design. Particularly, I’m interested in high load web application development and deployment and working in the team where good to sharing knolege between team members.

Currently learning Python more deeper and interested in Go programming. And I`ve plan to learned and take Professional Certificate as a GCP Cloud Architect. In general I’m open to challenges and at the same time I like working with best real-world solutions and open source solutions.
